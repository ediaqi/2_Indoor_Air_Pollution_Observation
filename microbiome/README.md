**Introduction to Data Analysis following High-Throughput Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene fragments and ITS regions**

This example R code outlines a basic data analysis workflow for 16S rRNA gene fragment and ITS region amplicon sequencing, including relative abundance, 
differential abundance, alpha and beta diversity, core analysis, and linear models. The code includes statistics and plotting functions. 

The prerequisites for this analysis are an ASV/OTU table, along with files containing taxonomic information and metadata.
